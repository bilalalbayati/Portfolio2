        Carp Fish Overview
    </h2>
    <p>Today I would like to talk about one of the specific kinds of fish called Carp.
       Carp are a large group of freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae, a very large 
       group of fish species. This group that is kept by aquarists includes species from 
       Eastern Europe, namely common Carp and koi, mirror carp or comoragh Carp, goldfish,
       and the Indian Carp. The most common species kept by aquarists is the koi/mirror carp.</p>

     About this blog?
    </h2>
    <p>This blog post will share an overview about fish called Carp fish which includes details
       such as what they eat, how to care for them properly at home aquariums, and if it's a delicious dish? </p>

    <h2> what is the Carp fish?</h2>
   <p>Carp fish is a type of freshwater fish. They live in the water. They eat plants that grow 
    in the water, and they also need to breathe oxygen from the air at the surface of the water.
    Their natural instinct is to eat plants in lakes or ponds or slow-moving streams near lakes
    or ponds. When there are plants there, carp fish will stay near them for food. Carp Fish
    can also be found in saltwater, but it's not their natural habitat, so carp fish needs to
    go inland when it wants to spawn then go back into saltwater after it's done spawning. 
    Carp fish eat mostly aquatic plants and small invertebrates such as insects and plankton.
    They can also consume zooplankton, which is made up of many small aquatic animals. 
    Carp primarily feed on diatoms and algae. Their diet varies depending on the season and
    factors such as temperature, water flow, and amount of silt in the water. </p> 

    <p>
        Some carp species also consume detritus - organic debris that bacteria have broken down 
        into simpler molecules for use as food by other organisms like worms, crustaceans, or 
        plants. Carp are air breathers with no need to surface for air, so they spend most of their
         time at depths of 2-4 meters (6-13 feet). 
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, we have to learn How to care for carp fish properly at home aquariums.so, 
        Caring for your new fish is just as important as getting them. The goal of this article is
         to give an overview of some things you can do to ensure they are living a long and happy
          life in their aquarium home. When care is taken, the process goes more smoothly, and you 
          will not have to worry about your fish's health. So let's get started! Caring for your 
          new fish at home aquariums is surprisingly easy when you know what steps to take.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I will be showing you how to make a delicious dish from carp fish that will 
             give your taste buds a pleasant, flavorful taste. The first step to be completed is
             cutting open the carp fish on both sides and removing the spine. The next step is
             taking some salt, pepper, vinegar, chili powder and using it as a rub on the outside
             of both fish pieces. After both pieces have been rubbed up with all of those spices,
             it's time to put them in the skillet and saute them with some oil for about three 
             minutes or until they are browned on both sides. After this step, our delicious meal
             is ready to eat.</p>
